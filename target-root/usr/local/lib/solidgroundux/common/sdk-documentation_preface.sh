# - Documentation Generator ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The Documentation Generator subgroup contains the tools used to extract, process, render,
# > and generate SolidGroundUX documentation.
#
# > The documentation system is built around the idea that documentation should live
# > close to the code it describes. Instead of maintaining a separate manual by hand,
# > source files contain structured comment blocks that can be converted into a
# > navigable HTML documentation set.
#
# > The file doc-sample.sh demonstrates the supported documentation conventions and
# > should be treated as the practical reference for writing documentation comments.
#
# -- Documentation Workflow ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The documentation pipeline consists of several stages.
#
# . Images
#   doc-generation-process.png :: Document generation process 
#
# > The processor reads source files and extracts module metadata, sections, items,
# > documentation lines, attribution data, and integrity information.
#
# > The renderer receives the normalized tables produced by the processor and turns
# > them into HTML pages, navigation, appendices, glossary entries, and supporting
# > assets.
#
# > The generator coordinates the overall process and acts as the main entry point
# > for producing the documentation set.
# >
# > Four generation modes are available:
# >
# >     1  Full              Reparse all matching source files and rebuild the complete set
# >     2  Selected          Reparse only explicitly selected matching files
# >     3  Changed           Reparse matching files changed since the selected baseline
# >     4  Render existing   Rebuild HTML from the persisted renderer data only
# >
# > Full generation cleans the output directory before rebuilding the complete set.
# > Selected and Changed generation preserve existing output so they can be used for
# > incremental updates. Successful parse modes persist the normalized renderer input
# > data, allowing Render existing data mode to regenerate HTML, navigation, CSS,
# > branding, and other renderer-owned output without rescanning source files.
# >
# > After files or modules are renamed or removed, use Full generation so obsolete
# > generated pages are deleted rather than surviving from an earlier documentation run.
# > Render existing data does not re-read source comments or metadata.
#
# -- Module Headers -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Documentation begins with the module header.
#
# > The Metadata section describes the module itself. Common fields include Version,
# > Build, Checksum, Source, Type, Group, Subgroup, and Purpose.
#
# > Version and Build identify the documented module version. Checksum can be used
# > for integrity tracking. Source identifies the original source file. Type
# > classifies the module, Group determines its primary documentation area, Subgroup
# > optionally introduces one additional grouping level, and Purpose provides a short
# > description of why the module exists.
#
# > The Attribution section describes ownership and licensing information. Common
# > fields include Developers, Company, Client, Copyright, and License.
#
# > These fields are used to generate attribution and integrity appendices, and help
# > keep generated documentation traceable back to the source files.
#
# -- Documentation Labels -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Structured documentation lines use a small set of labels to identify the type
# > of content being documented.
#
# > The primary labels are:
#
# >     fn:      Function or method documentation
# >     var:     Variable documentation
# >     cls:     Class documentation
# >     doc:     General documentation
#
# > Each label can be followed by either a colon or a dollar sign.
#
# > A colon indicates a normal documentation item:
#
# >     fn:      Normal function or method documentation
# >     var:     Normal variable documentation
# >     cls:     Normal class documentation
# >     doc:     Normal general documentation
#
# > A dollar sign indicates a template documentation item:
#
# >     fn$      Template function documentation
# >     var$     Template variable documentation
# >     cls$     Template class documentation
# >     doc$     Template general documentation
#
# > Template items are primarily intended for reusable examples and template files.
# > The renderer can treat them differently from normal framework items, depending
# > on the group or context in which they appear.
#
# > The documentation dialect is language-neutral where the host language supports the
# > same comment marker. Bash and Python both use # comments, so fn:, var:, cls:, and
# > doc: use the same syntax in both languages. Python functions and class methods both
# > use fn:; the containing cls: item supplies the class context.
# >
# > The file doc-sample.sh demonstrates the supported labels and should be treated
# > as the practical reference for the documentation syntax.
#
# -- Sections and Structure ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Documentation comments can define product, module, section, subsection, and item
# > content.
#
# > Section headers are used to group related functions, variables, configuration
# > values, or explanatory text.
#
# > This allows generated documentation to be organized as a navigable hierarchy
# > instead of a flat list of extracted comments.
#
# > Good sectioning is especially important in larger modules, where a long list of
# > functions would otherwise become difficult to read.
#
# -- Style Hints --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Documentation lines may include an optional leading marker that either identifies
# > plain documentation content or assigns a renderer style hint.
#
# > The plain documentation marker is:
#
# >     >           Plain documentation line
# >     >           When used without text, emits an intentional blank line
#
# > Style hints are presentation hints layered on top of the structural content type.
# > The renderer reads the exported stylehint value for each documentation line.
# > When the style hint is normal, no additional style class is added. When another
# > value is supplied, the renderer adds a corresponding sh-<stylehint> CSS class.
#
# > The currently supported style hints are:
#
# >     normal      Standard rendered text
# >     label       (:) Label or small subheader text
# >     highlight   (.) Highlighted text
# >     emphasis    (!) Emphasized text
# >     underline   (_) Underlined text
# >     quote       (~) Quoted or aside text
# >     listitem    (-) Bullet-style list item
# >     indent          Reserved indentation style
#
# > Marker characters are only interpreted when they are the first token after the
# > comment marker. Leading whitespace after "# " is preserved as author layout and
# > prevents marker interpretation.
#
# > These symbols are intended as visual cues and make it easier to identify the
# > purpose of a line while scanning a page.
#
# > Style hints should be used for presentation only. They do not replace content
# > labels such as fn:, fn$, var:, var$, doc:, or doc$.
#
# > The file doc-sample.sh should be treated as the practical reference for the
# > supported documentation syntax.
#
# -- Images -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Documentation can embed one image or a group of images directly from structured
# > source comments. An image block begins with a label or highlight line whose content
# > is exactly Image or Images, followed by one or more normal documentation lines.
# > A blank documentation line ends the image block.
# >
# > The common construction is:
# >
# >     # : Images
# >     # File name.png
# >     # Another image.png :: Optional caption
# >     #
# >
# > Singular Image is also accepted:
# >
# >     # : Image
# >     # Architecture.png :: Framework architecture
# >     #
# >
# > The marker may use either the label (:) or highlight (.) style hint. Image entries
# > themselves must remain normal documentation lines. The optional caption is separated
# > from the filename or source by a double colon (::). When no caption is supplied, the
# > renderer derives alternative text from the filename.
# >
# > Relative filenames are resolved beneath the generated assets/images directory.
# > Framework documentation assets placed under:
# >
# >     <source-root>/usr/local/lib/solidgroundux/assets
# >
# > are copied to the generated documentation assets/images directory before rendering.
# > Sources beginning with assets/ are resolved relative to the generated documentation
# > asset root. Absolute paths, http/https URLs, and data URLs are also accepted by the
# > renderer.
# >
# > Consecutive image entries are rendered as one responsive image group. The renderer
# > selects layouts for one, two, three, or four-column groups automatically; larger
# > groups continue using the four-column layout.
#
# -- Generated Output ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The generated documentation consists of an HTML index, content pages, stylesheet
# > assets, images, appendices, glossary pages, integrity information, and renderer-owned
# > site branding. Documented SolidGroundUX style modules can also receive generated
# > semantic theme specimens derived from their actual style and palette assignments.
# >
# > Project-level appendices are supplied from repository/project sources such as the
# > canonical architecture/conventions document, CHANGELOG, INSTALL guide, and license.
# > These prose sources should be maintained alongside the project and regenerated into
# > the HTML set rather than editing generated appendix pages directly.
#
# > The output is intentionally static HTML so it can be viewed in any browser
# > without requiring a web server, database, or application runtime.
#
# > This makes the documentation easy to publish, archive, review, and distribute
# > together with a release package.
#
# -- Documentation Conventions ------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Documentation comments should be written as part of normal development, not as
# > an afterthought at release time.
#
# > Module headers should be kept complete and current.
#
# > Public functions should include enough information for another developer to
# > understand their purpose, expected inputs, output, return behavior, and typical
# > usage.
#
# > Internal helpers may use shorter documentation, but should still explain intent
# > when the behavior is not obvious.
#
# > Empty documentation separator lines should use a plain comment line rather than
# > a quoted documentation line, to avoid stray quote markers in rendered output.
#
# -- Why Source-Based Documentation -------------------------------------------------
#
# > Script-heavy projects are especially vulnerable to documentation drift. Bash and
# > Python source files are easy to change quickly, and separate documentation is easy
# > to forget.
#
# > SolidGroundUX avoids this by treating source comments as the primary
# > documentation source.
#
# > This does not remove the need for prose, examples, or architectural explanation,
# > but it does make the reference documentation much more likely to stay close to
# > the implementation.
