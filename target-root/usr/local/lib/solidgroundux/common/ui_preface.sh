# - User Interface ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The SolidGroundUX user-interface layer provides a consistent vocabulary for
# > terminal output and interaction. It separates what an application wants to
# > communicate from the details of ANSI styling, terminal width, glyph selection,
# > prompt handling, and output policy.
#
# > Applications should normally use the public UI functions rather than assembling
# > escape sequences, labels, prompts, or status messages themselves. This keeps
# > scripts visually consistent and allows presentation rules to evolve without
# > requiring application code to be rewritten.
#
# -- UI Architecture ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The UI group is divided into small layers with distinct responsibilities:
#
# >     ui-glyphs.sh
# >         Shared symbols, separators, arrows, and fallback characters
# >
# >     ui.sh
# >         Core rendering, colors, themes, widths, title bars, sections, and values
# >
# >     ui-say.sh
# >         Message semantics, log-level filtering, console output, and file logging
# >
# >     ui-ask.sh
# >         Typed prompts, choices, validation, forms, and direct terminal input
# >
# >     ui-dlg.sh
# >         Higher-level decisions and dialog-oriented interaction flows
#
# > The lower layers do not depend on application-specific behavior. Higher layers
# > build on the rendering and input primitives below them. This keeps formatting,
# > messaging, and interaction concerns separate while still presenting one coherent
# > interface to applications.
#
# -- Rendering and Layout ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The rendering layer in `ui.sh` provides reusable functions for structured console
# > output. It handles visible string length, ANSI-aware padding, terminal width,
# > themes, foreground and background colors, text attributes, title bars, section
# > headers, filled lines, labeled values, and formatted cells.
#
# > Width-sensitive functions use visible character length rather than raw byte
# > length wherever possible. ANSI control sequences therefore do not disturb label
# > alignment or layout calculations.
#
# > Frequently used rendering functions include:
#
# >     sgnd_print_titlebar
# >     sgnd_print_sectionheader
# >     sgnd_print_labeledvalue
# >     sgnd_print_fill
# >     sgnd_print
# >     sgnd_print_single
# >     sgnd_print_file
# >     sgnd_print_cell
#
# > Application code should prefer these helpers over local `printf` formatting when
# > the output represents a standard SolidGroundUX UI element.
#
# -- Themes, Palettes, and Run Modes -------------------------------------------------
#
# > Styling is resolved centrally. Palettes define named colors and visual roles,
# > while themes determine how those roles are applied by the rendering functions.
# > This prevents consuming scripts from embedding ANSI codes or hard-coded color
# > choices.
#
# > The active style can reflect the current run mode, such as normal operation,
# > dry-run execution, debugging, or another framework-defined state. Applications
# > communicate intent through the public API; the UI layer selects the appropriate
# > visual representation.
#
# > When styling is disabled or unsupported, UI functions should degrade to readable
# > plain text without changing the semantic content of the output.
#
# -- Messages and Logging ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The messaging layer in `ui-say.sh` provides the standard way for scripts to emit
# > informational, successful, warning, error, debug, and progress-related messages.
# > Message type, log level, console visibility, and optional file logging are handled
# > independently from the application logic that produced the message.
#
# > This distinction is important: an application chooses the meaning and severity of
# > a message, while the framework decides whether and how that message is displayed
# > or recorded.
#
# > Scripts should therefore use the `say` family consistently instead of mixing
# > direct output with framework messages. Direct `printf` remains appropriate for
# > machine-readable output or for narrowly controlled rendering inside the UI
# > implementation itself.
#
# -- Prompts and User Input -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The prompt layer in `ui-ask.sh` provides interactive input without assuming that
# > standard input is available. Where necessary, prompts read from the controlling
# > terminal so that applications can still process redirected or piped input.
#
# > The public prompt API supports labeled input, editable defaults, validation,
# > constrained decisions, timed continuation, immediate key choices, and small
# > field-driven forms.
#
# > Principal functions include:
#
# >     ask
# >     ask_decision
# >     ask_dlg_autocontinue
# >     ask_choose
# >     ask_choose_immediate
# >     ask_prompt_form
#
# > Prompt functions normalize common interaction patterns so applications do not
# > need to reproduce terminal handling, label formatting, default-value behavior, or
# > response validation.
# >
# > Use `ask_decision` for an explicit user decision that should block until a choice is
# > made. Use `ask_dlg_autocontinue` for an interruptible timed continuation where the
# > normal path continues automatically but the operator may intervene, pause, redo, or
# > cancel according to the options supplied. These are distinct interaction patterns.
#
# -- Dialog-Oriented Interaction -----------------------------------------------------
#
# > The dialog layer in `ui-dlg.sh` builds structured decisions on top of the lower
# > prompt primitives. It expands symbolic choices, displays available actions,
# > normalizes keyboard input, translates dialog return codes, and supports timed
# > auto-continue behavior.
#
# > These helpers are intentionally lightweight. They provide predictable interaction
# > patterns for shell applications without introducing a full-screen terminal user
# > interface or a separate workflow engine.
#
# -- Glyphs and Character Fallbacks --------------------------------------------------
#
# > `ui-glyphs.sh` centralizes the visual symbols used throughout the framework.
# > Keeping glyphs in one place avoids repeated literal Unicode characters and makes
# > it possible to provide simpler fallbacks for restricted terminals.
#
# > Rendering code should refer to the shared glyph definitions rather than choosing
# > local arrows, checkmarks, separators, or box-drawing characters. This preserves a
# > recognizable visual language across the framework.
#
# -- Rendering Width and Message Routing ---------------------------------------------
#
# > Width-aware UI primitives derive their default width from the active terminal. An
# > explicit `--maxwidth` is honored when supplied, and `SGND_MAX_RENDER_WIDTH` acts as
# > an optional global cap; an unset or zero cap allows use of the full terminal width.
#
# > The `say*` family routes semantic messages independently to console and file output.
# > `SGND_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL` controls terminal visibility and `SGND_FILE_LOG_LEVEL`
# > controls persistent logging, allowing the two audiences to use different detail
# > levels.
#
# -- Guidance for Applications -------------------------------------------------------
#
# > A SolidGroundUX application should generally follow these rules:
#
# >     - Use `say` functions for user-facing status and diagnostic messages.
# >     - Use rendering helpers for standard titles, sections, labels, and tables.
# >     - Use prompt and dialog helpers for interactive decisions.
# >     - Do not embed ANSI escape sequences in application code.
# >     - Do not duplicate glyphs or terminal-width calculations locally.
# >     - Keep machine-readable output separate from styled human-readable output.
# >     - Respect non-interactive, quiet, debug, and dry-run execution modes.
#
# > Following these conventions gives command-line tools a shared appearance and,
# > more importantly, shared behavior. Users can learn one interaction model and
# > apply it across all SolidGroundUX applications.
#
# -- Scope and Non-Goals -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The UI framework is designed for structured command-line applications. It is not
# > intended to be a full-screen TUI toolkit, a graphical interface, or a replacement
# > for dedicated terminal-layout libraries.
#
# > Its goal is deliberately narrower: provide dependable, composable primitives for
# > readable output, consistent messaging, and predictable interaction in Bash.
