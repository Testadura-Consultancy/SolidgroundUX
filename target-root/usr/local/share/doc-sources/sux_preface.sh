# - How it came to pass... ---------------------------------------------------------
# > During a period in which I found myself lacking mental challenges in my current project, I decided to explore
# > the Linux world. Frustrated with the current software market, I envisioned creating a subscription-free,
# > vendor-neutral, on-site software solution. This started with configuring a few VMs, which quickly led to
# > needing to learn Bash. I received a lot of help with syntax from ChatGPT, but I quickly concluded that I
# > didn't want to have to type printf, read, and other boilerplate every time I wanted to communicate with
# > the user or request input.
#   
# > Coming from the C#/.NET ecosystem required some adjustment, especially letting go of object-oriented
# > thinking. Even so, I found myself constantly looking for ways to make things more modular, reusable,
# > and consistent.
#   
# > To make a long story short, six months later I present to you SolidGroundUX: a modular, reusable,
# > consistent, and hopefully enjoyable framework for building console applications in Bash. Not bad for a
# > first Bash project. I haven't configured a single VM since I started building it, so I sometimes wonder
# > whether the original plan still works...
# > Meanwhile, another 3 months later, having now configured many VMs in minutes rather than hours, we're at version 2.1. 
# > The framework is broader, cleaner, and architecturally grounded. What started as a way to make configuring 
# > a few Linux servers less tedious has become a framework for building, deploying, managing, and documenting 
# > them consistently.
#   
# > I'm releasing this software on GitHub under the Testadura Non-Commercial License (TD-NC) v1.1. This means
# > you can use it free of charge for non-commercial purposes, even within a commercial environment. However,
# > if you wish to use it as part of a commercial product or project, we will need to discuss licensing terms.
#   
# > I hope this framework makes someone's life a little easier. If you have suggestions for improvements,
# > discover a bug, or would like to contribute, feel free to reach out.
#  
# ~  What's in a name?
#
# > The name SolidGround originates from a .NET ETL orchestration framework that I have been developing over
# > the past ten years. That product is currently awaiting its adaptation to Linux and the Avalonia UI
# > framework, after which it is intended to be released as a commercial product in the hopefully near future.
#   
# > The name SolidGroundUX is a nod to that project and reflects the same philosophy: providing solid,
# > practical foundations on which other software can be built.
#  
# - SolidGroundUX in a nutshell ------------------------------------------------------
#
# > SolidGroundUX is the runtime framework for structured Bash applications. It provides
# > bootstrap and execution conventions, argument handling, configuration and state,
# > logging, terminal UI primitives, reusable libraries, metadata support, and common
# > APIs used by applications built on the framework.
#
# > Version 2.1 separates that runtime from two products built around it:
# >
# >     SolidGroundUX Framework
# >         Runtime, bootstrap, common libraries, configuration/state, UI, and reusable APIs.
# >
# >     SolidGroundUX Management Console Modules (MCM)
# >         The `sgnd-console` host and the server-management modules that run in it.
# >
# >     SolidGroundUX SDK
# >         Workspace, deployment, documentation, packaging, and release tooling.
# >
# > MCM and SDK both depend on the Framework. They are sibling products and do not depend
# > on each other. This boundary keeps the installed runtime small while allowing management
# > and development tooling to evolve independently.

#
# - Framework capabilities summary --------------------------------------------------
#
# -- Bootstrap and runtime initialization -------------------------------------------
# > Executables begin with the lightweight framework locator, load `sgnd-exe-common.sh`,
# > and then enter the normal bootstrap sequence. Bootstrap establishes the runtime
# > environment, global definitions, configuration/state, logging, UI support, and any
# > additional libraries declared by the executable.
#
# -- Library loading with sgnd_using -------------------------------------------------
# > Applications declare additional Framework libraries through `SGND_USING`. Bootstrap
# > resolves and loads those dependencies after the core runtime is available.
#
# -- Arguments, configuration, and state --------------------------------------------
# > The Framework provides a common model for built-in and application arguments,
# > layered configuration, persistent state, validation, and transfer of selected values
# > between invocations.
#
# -- Logging and terminal UI ---------------------------------------------------------
# > Screen messaging, file logging, themes, palettes, title bars, sections, typed prompts,
# > dialogs, and menu primitives share one vocabulary and one runtime policy.
#
# -- Reusable APIs ------------------------------------------------------------------
# > Common libraries provide metadata/header parsing, datatable helpers, system helpers,
# > menu mechanics, and other functionality that is useful across multiple applications.
# > Product-specific behavior stays with the product that owns it.
#
# -- Products built on the Framework ------------------------------------------------
# > The Management Console Modules product owns the management-console host, public
# > `sgnd-console` command, module discovery/lazy loading, and server-management modules.
# > The SDK owns project/workspace tooling, documentation generation, deployment tooling,
# > release preparation, release management, and development templates.
#
# - Architecture --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# . Images
#   sux-framework-architecture.png :: SolidGroundUX product and framework architecture.
#
# > The Framework is the shared runtime beneath independently installable products and
# > applications. Applications consume public Framework APIs; product-specific orchestration
# > remains outside the Framework itself.
#
# -- Framework Locator and Resource Resolution --------------------------------------
#
# . Images
#   sux-framework-locator.png :: Framework locator and resource-resolution model.
#
# > `SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT` describes the contextual root from which the executable is
# > running. It is `/` for an installed execution and normally a repository `target-root`
# > for a development execution.
#
# > Framework-owned resources are not assumed to live beneath that contextual root.
# > `sgnd_framework_resolve_path` first uses the contextual tree when that tree actually
# > contains a Framework installation; otherwise it resolves the resource from the
# > installed Framework under `/`. A development MCM or SDK tree can therefore run its
# > own code while consuming the installed Framework without changing
# > `SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT`.
#
# -- Bootstrap Architecture ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# . Images
#   sux-bootstrap-sequence.png :: Framework executable bootstrap sequence.
#
# > Startup deliberately has a small pre-bootstrap boundary:
# >
# >     executable
# >         -> _framework_locator
# >         -> sgnd-exe-common
# >         -> sgnd-bootstrap
# >         -> bootstrap environment/configuration/state
# >         -> requested libraries
# >         -> application main
# >
# > The locator and executable-common layer must work before the full Framework runtime
# > exists. Once bootstrap has completed, applications should use normal Framework APIs
# > rather than duplicating root, configuration, or library-resolution logic.
#
# -- Public and Internal APIs --------------------------------------------------------
#
# > SolidGroundUX uses naming conventions to distinguish public APIs from internal
# > implementation details.
#   
# > Public framework functions use `sgnd_*` and are intended for application and tool
# > consumers.
# >
# > Framework-internal functions use `_sgnd_*`. They are effectively protected: other
# > cooperating SolidGroundUX libraries may depend on them, but they are not part of
# > the supported application-facing API.
# >
# > Plain leading-underscore helpers such as `_helper` are local/private implementation
# > details belonging to one script or module. Bash cannot enforce these access levels,
# > but the convention communicates intended ownership. Consumers should rely on the
# > public `sgnd_*` surface unless they are implementing framework internals.
#
# -- Convention Over Configuration ---------------------------------------------------
#
# > One of the primary design goals of SolidGroundUX is reducing repetitive code.
#   
# > Common functionality such as argument processing, configuration loading, state
# > management, user interaction, documentation generation, and deployment support
# > are implemented once and reused throughout the framework.
#   
# > Developers remain free to override framework behavior when necessary, but most
# > applications can rely on framework conventions and focus primarily on business
# > logic.
