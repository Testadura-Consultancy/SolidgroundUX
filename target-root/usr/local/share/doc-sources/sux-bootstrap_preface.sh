# - Bootstrap -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Bootstrap turns a small executable entry point into a fully initialized
# > SolidGroundUX runtime. Version 2.1 distinguishes the executable's contextual root
# > from the location used to resolve Framework-owned resources. That distinction is
# > what allows SDK and MCM development trees to use an installed Framework cleanly.

#
# > Startup proceeds in this order:
# >
# >     executable
# >         -> _framework_locator
# >         -> sgnd-exe-common
# >         -> sgnd-bootstrap
# >         -> bootstrap environment
# >         -> configuration and state
# >         -> libraries declared in SGND_USING
# >         -> application main
# >
# > `_framework_locator` is intentionally self-contained. It runs before the normal
# > Framework libraries are available and locates `sgnd-exe-common.sh`. The executable
# > common layer then provides the early runtime needed to enter `sgnd-bootstrap`.
#
# -- Bootstrap Environment ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# > `SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT` is the contextual root of the executing tree. In an installed
# > execution it is normally `/`; in a development execution it normally identifies the
# > repository `target-root`.
#
# > A contextual root is not automatically a Framework root. When Framework-owned files
# > are required, `sgnd_framework_resolve_path` checks whether the contextual tree really
# > contains the Framework. If it does, local Framework resources take precedence with
# > installed `/` as fallback. If it does not, resources resolve directly from the
# > installed Framework.
#
# > This leaves application/project configuration and state semantics intact while
# > preventing SDK or MCM development directories from masquerading as Framework trees.

#
# -- Automatic Library Loading ------------------------------------------------------
#
# > SolidGroundUX uses a dependency declaration mechanism to determine which
# > libraries should be available to a script.
#   
# > Scripts can populate `SGND_USING` to declare framework libraries they depend on.
# > During bootstrap, the framework resolves these entries and sources the required
# > files automatically.
#   
# > This keeps executable scripts smaller and makes dependencies explicit near the
# > top of the file. Instead of scattering `source` statements throughout the script,
# > the script declares what it needs and lets the bootstrap layer perform the actual
# > loading.
#   
# > Core libraries needed by bootstrap are loaded automatically. Project definitions are
# > sourced explicitly as foundational globals rather than through `SGND_USING`; additional
# > libraries are then loaded from the script's declared requirements.
#
# -- Global Definitions -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The bootstrap process also prepares common SolidGroundUX global variables.
#   
# > These globals describe the runtime environment and provide shared values used by
# > other framework components. They may include resolved paths, script metadata,
# > runtime flags, configuration locations, and other common settings.
#   
# > Configurable values are described through the current scoped registries. Framework
# > settings use
# > `SGND_FRAMEWORK_GLOBALS`; application settings use `SGND_SCRIPT_GLOBALS`; runtime
# > definitions and defaults are supplied by the bootstrap/environment layer.
# >
# > These registries bridge static defaults, system/user configuration files, runtime
# > state, and command-line overrides without requiring each executable to implement
# > its own configuration model.
#
# -- Configuration Management -------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Configuration handling is integrated into the bootstrap lifecycle.
#   
# > When configuration-related globals are available, the framework can initialize
# > configuration metadata, determine expected configuration files, load values, and
# > apply them before the main application logic runs.
#   
# > This means a script can define the values it cares about, while the framework
# > handles the repetitive work of loading, overriding, and exposing those values.
#   
# > The result is a consistent configuration model across scripts without requiring
# > every executable to implement its own configuration parser.
#
#
# -- Transferable Framework State ---------------------------------------------------
#
# > Every executable bootstraps its own SolidGroundUX framework instance. Ordinary
# > shell globals therefore remain local to that process and are not automatically
# > shared with executables started from it.
#   
# > SolidGroundUX preserves selected user-level runtime choices through a transferable
# > framework state file. The file is identified by `SGND_FRAMEWORK_STATEFILE` and is
# > normally resolved as:
#   
# >     $SGND_USRCFG_DIR/framework.state
#   
# > After the normal framework configuration has been loaded, bootstrap recalculates
# > this filename from the effective user configuration directory. If the file exists,
# > the variables listed in `SGND_FRAMEWORK_STATE` are loaded from it. If it does not
# > exist, bootstrap creates it from the current effective values.
#   
# > The framework state is applied before the UI palette and style are loaded. This
# > allows a theme or logging choice changed by one SolidGroundUX executable to be used
# > by subsequently started executables, even though each executable creates its own
# > framework instance.
#   
# > Only explicitly listed variables are transferable. Process-specific values such as
# > script metadata, progress state, start times, and application-local state remain
# > private to the current executable. The framework state file is therefore a small
# > runtime overlay, not a dump of all framework globals and not a replacement for the
# > normal system and user configuration files.
#   
# > The current transferable set is maintained in `SGND_FRAMEWORK_STATE` and includes
# > the active console and file log levels, UI style and palette, and the date format
# > used by `say()` output. Runtime functions that change one of these settings should
# > update the framework state file when the change must remain visible to later
# > framework instances.
#
# -- Console and File Log Levels ----------------------------------------------------
#
# > Console output and logfile output are controlled independently.
#   
# > `SGND_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL` controls which `say()` messages are rendered to the
# > terminal. `SGND_FILE_LOG_LEVEL` controls which messages are appended to the
# > resolved logfile. Both settings support the levels:
#   
# >     silent, quiet, normal, verbose, debug, trace
#   
# > A message can therefore be suppressed on screen while still being recorded in the
# > logfile, or displayed on screen while file logging is effectively disabled. Setting
# > `SGND_FILE_LOG_LEVEL` to `silent` disables logfile output without requiring a
# > separate enable flag.
#   
# > `say()` evaluates the console and file thresholds separately. Matching logfile
# > entries are always written with a date/time prefix using `SAY_DATE_FORMAT`,
# > regardless of whether timestamps are currently shown on the console.
#   
# > The active log levels are part of `SGND_FRAMEWORK_STATE`, so changes saved during
# > one framework instance become the starting values for later SolidGroundUX
# > executables run by the same user.
#
# -- Built-in Arguments -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# > Bootstrapped executables receive a set of framework-provided command-line
# > arguments.
#   
# > These built-in options cover common framework behavior such as help output,
# > version information, diagnostic output, tracing or debugging behavior, and
# > configuration-related overrides.
#   
# > Application-specific arguments can be added by the executable itself, but common
# > framework behavior remains standardized across all bootstrapped tools.
# >
# > Framework-provided and application-specific arguments may be freely intermixed on
# > the command line. Bootstrap extracts recognized framework builtins while preserving
# > application-specific options and positional values in their original order for the
# > later script-level parse. Argument meaning therefore does not depend on whether a
# > builtin appears before, between, or after application-specific options.
# >
# > The standard `--` marker is an absolute end-of-options boundary. Once encountered,
# > everything following it is preserved as positional data, even when a following
# > value happens to resemble a framework or application option.
# >
# > Script-specific command-line values are applied after script configuration and
# > state have been loaded. Explicit command-line values can therefore override stored
# > or configured script values while framework builtins remain available independently
# > of their position on the command line.
#   
# > This gives SolidGroundUX applications a shared command-line personality: once a
# > user understands the standard options for one tool, the same expectations apply
# > to the others.
#
# -- Relationship to the Executable Template ----------------------------------------
#
# > The executable template contains the preferred bootstrap structure for new
# > command-line tools.
#   
# > When creating a new SolidGroundUX executable, start from the template rather than
# > copying bootstrap code from an existing script by hand. Existing scripts may
# > contain historical details, local deviations, or project-specific behavior,
# > while the template represents the current intended pattern.
#   
# > In practical terms, the template shows where to declare dependencies, where to
# > define globals, where to register custom arguments, and where application logic
# > begins after bootstrap has completed.
#
# -- Why Bootstrap Matters ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# > The bootstrap layer exists to keep scripts boring in the best possible way.
#   
# > A bootstrapped executable does not need to rediscover the framework, reimplement
# > argument parsing, manually source every common library, or invent its own
# > configuration lifecycle.
#   
# > That work is centralized once, tested once, and reused everywhere.
#   
# > This is one of the main reasons SolidGroundUX behaves like a framework rather
# > than a collection of unrelated Bash helpers.
