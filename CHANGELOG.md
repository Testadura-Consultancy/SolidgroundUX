# Unreleased

# Build 2.0.2623404

## Changed
- Improved Samba File Server and share-management usability:
  - Removed printer-share validation from the Samba file-server validation path.
  - Added repeat-operation flows for creating and removing Samba shares.
  - Added share selection when removing managed shares.
  - Updated the Samba share manager to use `ask_selection` for share and Active Directory group selection.
  - Active Directory groups are now discovered directly from the directory through LDAP instead of relying on NSS group enumeration.
  - LDAP group discovery uses Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication and disables SASL hostname canonicalization so the registered domain-controller LDAP service principal is used correctly.
  - Active Directory realm names are normalized to uppercase for Kerberos authentication while NSS group identities retain their resolvable `group@domain` form.
  - The share manager now detects a missing Kerberos ticket and interactively authenticates an Active Directory user before querying directory groups.

- Added `R Reset` to the management console, allowing last-run result markers to be cleared for the current module page without affecting results on other pages.

- Moved manual console redraw from `R` to `Ctrl+R`; redraw continues to re-measure the terminal and invalidate layout-dependent caches.

- Updated the console key legend to show `R Reset` and `Ctrl+R Redraw`.

- Added a `--legend` argument to `ask_dlg_autocontinue`, allowing callers to replace the generic key legend with workflow-specific instructions.

- Improved Active Directory Management usability:
  - Added consistent `Q` / Quit handling to framework-owned prompts.
  - Added `--back` support to `ask` so free-text prompts can return cleanly without assigning or validating the entered value.
  - Removed redundant confirmation prompts from user and group creation/deletion flows where choosing the action and selecting/entering the object already expresses intent.
  - Added optional “password never expires” handling during user creation.
  - Added a dedicated “Set password never expires” user action.
  - Added repeat-operation loops for:
    - Create user
    - Delete user
    - Remove user from groups
    - Create group
    - Add users to group
    - Remove group members
    - Delete group
  - Repeat-operation dialogs now use custom legends so timeout and Enter behavior are described accurately.
  - Disabled the normal menu post-action wait for actions that now manage their own repeat/return flow.

- Improved console width handling:
  - Terminal width is re-measured on redraw.
  - Rendering no longer relies on a separately cached menu width.
  - Layout caches are invalidated on redraw so resized terminals are recalculated correctly.
  - Non-interactive processes no longer fail when `/dev/tty` is unavailable.

## Repaired
- Repaired Storage provisioning confirmation handling:
  - Fixed remaining Yes/No comparisons that expected mixed-case values instead of the canonical `YES` / `NO` responses returned by `ask_decision`.
  - Verified storage provisioning now completes partitioning, filesystem creation, persistent `/etc/fstab` configuration, mounting, and creation of `/srv/storage/shares`.
  - Verified storage status correctly reports the configured source, filesystem, UUID, mount state, persistence, read/write state, capacity, and available space.

- Repaired Samba File Server provisioning and validation:
  - Removed validation of Samba printer shares, which are not part of the managed SolidGroundUX file-server configuration.
  - Verified the Samba preparation sequence completes successfully against provisioned SolidGroundUX storage.
  - Repaired managed share creation and removal workflows.

- Repaired Active Directory group handling in the Samba share manager:
  - Fixed AD group discovery on realmd/SSSD domain members where `getent group` cannot enumerate directory groups even though direct qualified-name lookups work.
  - Replaced unsuitable `samba-tool group list` discovery, which expects a local Active Directory database when run on a member server.
  - Avoided `net ads group`, which requires Samba ADS membership configuration not present on the realmd/SSSD client.
  - Added authenticated LDAP group discovery using the domain controller advertised through the Active Directory LDAP SRV record.
  - Fixed Kerberos authentication failures caused by using a lowercase realm; authentication now uses the canonical uppercase realm such as `TESTADURA.HQ`.
  - Fixed LDAP/GSSAPI service-ticket lookup by disabling SASL hostname canonicalization with `ldapsearch -N`.
  - Verified LDAP group enumeration against the domain controller and NSS resolution of selected qualified AD groups.

- Repaired Computer Setup validation:
  - Corrected the sudoers file path used for SolidGroundUX receiver access.
  - Centralized the sudoers filename in `SGND_COMPUTER_SUDOERS_FILE`.
  - Verified setup, status, and validation all reference the same sudoers policy file.

- Fully tested and repaired the Computer Setup workflow, including the automated preparation sequence.

- Fully tested and repaired Active Directory provisioning:
  - Fixed `ask_decision` case handling where canonical responses are returned in uppercase.
  - Restored the automated provisioning sequence so it continues beyond preflight validation.
  - Verified the remaining provisioning steps can complete successfully.

- Repaired Active Directory Management confirmation handling:
  - Fixed Yes/No comparisons so canonical `YES` / `NO` values are handled correctly.
  - Fixed Quit handling so `Q` actually exits the current action instead of falling through.
  - Fixed timeout handling in repeat-operation dialogs so timeout repeats the action instead of returning to the menu.

- Repaired terminal-width detection for non-interactive receiver execution:
  - Fixed `/dev/tty` probing so receiver-side operations no longer emit `No such device or address`.


# Release 2.0.2623316

## SolidGround Management Console

### Changed

- Reordered automated Computer Setup to generate SSH host keys before enabling and starting SSH.
- Changed Yes/No prompts in console modules from `YES/NO` to `Yes/No`.
- Corrected heading levels in the changelog.
- Corrected `sgnd_print_sectionheader` width calculation to use visible render width consistently.
- Added consistent visual separation before `ask_dlg_continue` prompts.
- Added automatic label-column sizing to console menu pages and the management-console index.

### Added

- Added `ask_selection`, a reusable single- and multi-selection ask primitive.
- Migrated selection workflows in `prepare-release.sh` and `untar-it.sh` to `ask_selection`.
- Added `manage-samba-shares.sh` for assigning Active Directory group access to Samba shares.
- Added `27-active-directory-management.sh` for managing Active Directory users, groups, memberships, and computer accounts.
- Added `50-web-server.sh` for preparing, validating, and inspecting an Nginx web-server role.
- Added `60-sqlserver.sh` for preparing, validating, and inspecting a Microsoft SQL Server role.
- Added `50-SolidGroundUX` to display SolidGroundUX version, license, documentation, and management information in the system MOTD.

# Release 2.0.2623211

## SolidGround Framework

### Changed
- `sgnd_style_samples` is now the canonical runtime showcase for the active
  theme, combining semantic theme colors with examples of the framework's
  rendering primitives.
- Theme message samples now use `sgnd_print` directly with the corresponding
  `LBL_*` and `MSG_CLR_*` values instead of invoking the `say*` message
  functions.
- The General UI Elements specimen now explicitly demonstrates
  `sgnd_print`, `sgnd_print_single`, `sgnd_print_labeledvalue`,
  `sgnd_print_labeledmultivalue`, `sgnd_print_fill`,
  `sgnd_print_sectionheader`, and `sgnd_print_titlebar`.
- The theme showcase now includes a non-interactive `ask` simulation using the
  active prompt and input colors without waiting for user input.
- The existing run-mode, state, validation, and progress specimens are retained
  as part of the consolidated theme showcase.
- The theme-color specimen now lists Message, Progress, and UI semantic color
  variables together with their resolved palette color name, RGB hex value, or
  indexed-color value.

## SolidGround Management Console

### Changed
- The Management Console host script was renamed to `management-console.sh`
  while retaining `sgnd-console` as the public command.
- The Management Console index now uses the same standard bottom control bar as
  normal console pages, accurately reflecting that the direct keyboard controls
  remain active on the index.
- Console selection handling is now more forgiving: invalid selections are
  reported and input is cleared before waiting for a new selection rather than
  allowing invalid input to terminate or disrupt the console flow.
- Manage Visibility selection now reports invalid entries explicitly instead of
  silently restarting the selection cycle.

### Repaired
- Numeric menu selections are interpreted explicitly as base-10 values,
  preventing Bash octal interpretation from affecting selections such as `08`.
- Console dispatch no longer treats an empty or invalid user selection as a
  shell-level missing-argument error.
- Post-action wait state is cleared before a new selection is dispatched so an
  invalid selection cannot inherit the wait interval from a previous action.

## Development Tools

### Added
- Added `sync-repository.sh` for synchronizing the development repository from
  the development server to a configured backup or workstation over SSH/SCP.
- Repository synchronization settings for destination machine, user, and
  directory are persisted through SolidGroundUX state for reuse on subsequent
  runs.

### Changed
- Repository synchronization now stages the incoming copy in a temporary
  destination and replaces the existing repository only after a successful
  transfer, so files removed from the source are also removed from the
  synchronized copy without deleting the last good copy first.
- `sync-repository.sh` now records a lightweight source-tree signature and the
  last successful synchronization time, allowing unchanged repositories to be
  skipped while still detecting additions, changes, renames, and removals.
- Added a force option to repository synchronization for explicitly refreshing
  the destination even when the stored source-tree signature is unchanged.

# Release 2.0.2623201

## SolidGround Framework

### Added
- `sync-repository.sh` was added to facilitate cloning reporsitories to (backup) machines
- `doc-generator` now supports comma-separated source masks, with the default
  expanded to `*.sh,*.py` so Bash and Python modules can participate in the
  same documentation generation workflow.

- Added an optional documentation `Subgroup` level beneath Group. Modules
  without a subgroup remain direct children of their Group, while subgroup
  prefaces and epilogues render around the subgroup's modules.

- Added persistent renderer export data beneath the documentation output so
  HTML can be regenerated without reparsing the full source tree.

- Added **Render existing data** as generation mode 4 and CLI mode
  `--mode render`. This mode validates the persisted renderer cache, skips
  source scanning/parsing, and reruns only the HTML renderer.

- Added generated-site branding support to the Python renderer, including
  SolidGroundUX documentation branding on content pages and Testadura
  publisher branding above the navigation index.

- Added functional documentation branding asset names:
  `doc-index-logo.png`, `doc-header-logo.png`, and `doc-index-hero.png`,
  decoupling renderer placement from a specific brand filename.

- Added generated semantic theme specimens for documented SolidGroundUX style
  modules. Theme previews are derived from the actual style and palette
  assignments rather than maintained as static screenshots.

- Added `cls:` as a first-class documentation item marker for Python classes.
  Python methods continue to use the existing language-neutral `fn:` marker.

### Changed
- Added public `sgnd_menu_dispatch` support so standalone framework tools can
  execute registered menu actions through the reusable menu API instead of
  maintaining their own dispatch logic.

- Added optional menu chrome control so consumers such as
  `framework-smoketest.sh` can use the public menu renderer without the
  Management Console togglebar and navigation legend.

- `framework-smoketest.sh` now builds, renders, reads, and dispatches its test
  menu through the public `sgnd-menu.sh` API while retaining its 30-second
  inactivity timeout.

- The framework smoke-test progress demo now uses genuinely nested stacked
  progress levels so lower-level work completes repeatedly while parent levels
  advance independently.

- Shared console-internal helpers used by more than one module or framework
  library now live in `lib/common/console-helpers.sh`, avoiding dependencies on
  another lazy-loaded console module having been opened first.

- `doc-generator` now derives clean-output behavior from the selected generation
  mode: Full generation always cleans the output directory, while Selected and
  Changed generation preserve existing output for incremental updates.

- Documentation file matching now uses one comma-separated mask contract across
  Full, Selected, and Changed generation modes.

- The documentation hierarchy now supports Group → optional Subgroup → Module,
  with navigation depth derived from the module's actual hierarchy level.

- `sgnd_doc_renderer.py` is now documented as part of the
  **SDK → Documentation Generator** subgroup alongside the Bash generator,
  processor, and renderer wrapper.

- Renderer exports are no longer purely temporary: successful parse modes
  persist the normalized PSV dataset for fast renderer-only iteration.

- Documentation branding assets are copied into the generated site so the HTML
  output remains self-contained.

- The documentation dialect is now shared between Bash and Python: both use
  `#`-prefixed `fn:`, `var:`, `doc:`, and `cls:` markers and feed the same
  normalized renderer data model.

- Documentation page branding now acts as a sticky page header and remains
  visible while scrolling generated content.

- Documentation diagrams are being moved from ASCII-only prose toward
  dedicated visual figures while retaining the source-authored technical
  content and hierarchy.

- The default UI palette now uses explicit 24-bit truecolor values instead of
  terminal-defined ANSI colors, providing consistent SolidGroundUX colors
  independently of the terminal's configured color palette.

- Width-aware UI primitives now delegate their default width policy to
  `sgnd_render_width`; when `--maxwidth` is omitted they use the current
  terminal width, while explicit widths remain honored.

- `SGND_MAX_RENDER_WIDTH` is now an optional global render cap: when unset or
  set to `0`, UI primitives may use the full terminal width; positive values
  continue to enforce an explicit maximum.

- `sgnd_print_titlebar`, `sgnd_print_sectionheader`, `sgnd_print_fill`,
  `sgnd_print`, `sgnd_print_single`, `sgnd_print_labeledvalue`, and
  `sgnd_print_labeledmultivalue` now follow the same dynamic-width behavior.

- `sgnd_print_sectionheader` now extends full-width or trailing borders to the
  current console width by default unless an explicit `--maxwidth` is supplied.

### Repaired
- Fixed documentation navigation depth for modules inside a subgroup so module
  sections and items render one level deeper than direct Group modules.

- Corrected the SolidGround Management Console preface grouping so its
  architecture/lifecycle documentation renders under the
  **SolidGround Console** group instead of **Common Core**.

- Renderer-only generation now fails explicitly when no valid persisted render
  dataset is available instead of silently falling back to a full parse.

- `deploy-workspace.sh` could fail when the remote receiver required `sudo`
  authentication. It now creates a narrowly scoped remote `sudoers` rule for
  `receive-files.sh`, allowing remote deployments to run non-interactively after
  the initial setup.

## SolidGround Management Console

### Added
- Added a lightweight main index page that discovers available console pages
  without sourcing their implementation modules.

- Added lazy page loading: a console module is sourced only when its page is
  opened for the first time, then remains loaded for the rest of the console
  session.

- Added root-only **Manage visibility** (`V`) on the main index page. Module
  visibility is persisted through the existing console-module state file and
  the index is refreshed immediately after changes.

- Added a dedicated **SolidGroundUX** page containing framework information,
  configuration, state, logging, diagnostics, the interactive Release Manager,
  and direct release-manager actions for check, download, update, install,
  rollback, and removal.

- Added **Storage** and **Storage Access** as dedicated Management Console
  functionality, including provisioning, mount/unmount, expansion, validation,
  status, ownership, group, and permission management.

### Changed
- Management Console startup now loads only lightweight page metadata. Detailed
  groups, menu items, and implementation functions are registered when the
  selected page is first opened.

- Previously loaded pages remain resident for the lifetime of the console
  process instead of being unloaded when leaving a page.

- `Esc` now returns from a loaded page to the main index, allowing direct page
  navigation without traversing intermediate modules.

- The main index now follows the standard console title and menu-row visual
  conventions, including hostname display, aligned descriptions, and a
  dedicated section for console-management actions.

- Removed the separate Console Settings page in favor of the existing direct
  quick-access controls for mode, access, logging, theme, redraw, page length,
  and shell access.

- Normal menu actions now restore the interruptible post-action auto-continue
  window with a minimum wait of 15 seconds, while immediate toggle actions can
  still redraw without delay.

- Shared helpers required by multiple lazy-loaded console modules are now
  provided by `lib/common/console-helpers.sh` rather than being owned by one
  module and implicitly depended on by another.

- The Management Console preface was rewritten for the current index-based,
  lazy-loading architecture and renamed
  `solidground-management-console_preface.sh`.

- Moved the paging indicator from the bottom-right corner to a centered position above
  the menu, making additional pages more obvious. The indicator is hidden when only
  one page is available.

- The `Q` legend is now context-aware: `Quit` is shown in the root console and `Back`
  in submenus.

- Removed the experimental role-aware menu filtering/toggle from the current
  console architecture; page visibility is now controlled explicitly through
  the persistent root-only **Manage visibility** action.

### Repaired
- Fixed cross-module helper dependencies exposed by lazy loading, including DNS
  configuration helpers used by both Active Directory Server and Active
  Directory Client pages.

- Fixed the lazy-page event loop no longer honoring registered post-action wait
  times.

- Fixed smoke-test menu selections being lost because the timed input helper
  shadowed the caller's output variable.

- Fixed standalone public-menu consumers failing on `_sgnd_flag_is_on` because
  the helper was defined only by the Management Console host.

- Fixed the Storage Access group visibility value being accidentally changed
  from enabled (`1`) to `15`.

- The Samba Active Directory package installation now explicitly includes
  `samba-common-bin`, ensuring the required `samba-tool` command is installed
  as a direct dependency of the SolidGroundUX AD-server role.

# Build 1.9.2622402 - 2026-08-12
## SolidGround Framework

### Added

-   Added `sgnd_clear` to the shared UI layer as the canonical screen-clear
    primitive for SolidGroundUX console applications. It clears the visible
    display and returns the cursor to the home position without attempting to
    erase terminal scrollback.
-   `sgnd_exe_start` now supports `--no-title`, allowing executable scripts such
    as `sgnd-console.sh` to suppress the standard startup title bar when they
    provide their own full-screen rendering.
-   Generic executable title bars now include the executing script's own
    canonical metadata Version and Build number when available, making
    the active script revision immediately visible at runtime.

-   Added `sgnd-definitions.sh` as the canonical source for
    SolidGroundUX framework identity, version/build information, default
    settings, framework registries, and core-library declarations.
-   Added `sgnd_print_labeledmultivalue`, a multiline variant of
    `sgnd_print_labeledvalue` that keeps the label on the first line
    while allowing values to span multiple lines.
-   `sgnd_print_labeledmultivalue` accepts either:
    -   A single string, optionally wrapped to a configurable value
        width.
    -   An array of values, with each item rendered on a separate
        aligned line.
-   Added `ask_datetime`, a datetime-aware variant of `ask` that accepts
    both absolute dates and SolidGroundUX relative date/time
    expressions.
-   Added the following datetime shortcuts:
    -   `N` -- Current date and time.
    -   `D` -- Today at the start of the day.
    -   `s` -- Seconds.
    -   `m` -- Minutes.
    -   `h` -- Hours.
    -   `d` -- Days.
    -   `M` -- Months.
    -   `y` -- Years.
    -   Relative expressions such as `-2m`, `-2h`, `+30m`, `-1d`, `-3M`,
        and `-1y`.
-   Relative datetime expressions are resolved immediately and returned
    as absolute ISO-8601 timestamps.
-   `ask_datetime` now displays the resolved absolute timestamp when a
    shorthand expression is entered.
-   Added an interactive `ask_datetime` test to the framework smoke
    test.

### Changed

-   `sgnd_print` and `sgnd_print_single` now calculate alignment and automatic
    wrapping from visible text width rather than raw string length, so embedded
    ANSI styling no longer distorts centering and right/left justification.
-   `sgnd_print` wrapping behavior is now explicit and consistent: long text
    wraps automatically, `--wrap 1` forces wrapping, and `--wrap 0` disables it.
-   The standard clear-screen sequence was deliberately reduced to cursor-home
    plus visible-display erase (`ESC[H ESC[2J]`). Scrollback clearing is no
    longer attempted because terminal emulators handle saved-line history and
    resize reflow differently.

## SolidGround Management Console

### Added

-   Added persistent console-module visibility state, with module
    identifiers derived conventionally from module filenames.
-   Added **Manage modules** to **Console Session**, allowing console
    modules to be enabled or disabled without editing configuration
    files manually.
-   Added role-aware console visibility so Active Directory server,
    Active Directory client, DNS, user/group, and Samba file-server
    functionality is only exposed when the corresponding role packages
    are installed.
-   Added the executing machine hostname to the Management Console title
    bar, making machine identity immediately visible across local and
    remote sessions.
-   Added transient console initialization/progress feedback while
    paths, configuration, built-in menu items, and console modules are
    loaded.
-   Added `Shift+S` as an immediate shortcut for opening an interactive child
    shell and returning to the Management Console on `exit`.
-   Added `Ctrl+R` as an immediate console restart shortcut. Restart uses `exec`
    so the current process is replaced rather than nested and preserves the
    original console arguments and current dry-run/commit state.
-   Added an on-screen shortcut legend for shell, restart, quit, and page
    navigation controls.

### Changed

-   Consolidated all package-related actions into a dedicated **Package
    Management** module, including base packages, Active Directory
    server/client packages, Samba File Server, XRDP, and Docker.
-   Console module load control now follows SolidGroundUX
    convention-over-configuration: module IDs are derived from filenames
    rather than duplicated as explicit module declarations.
-   Disabled console modules are no longer sourced; modules without an
    explicit visibility-state entry remain enabled by default for
    backward compatibility.
-   Console screen clearing now uses an explicit ANSI
    erase-display/cursor-home sequence instead of the host `clear`
    implementation, producing consistent rendering across SSH/PowerShell
    and VS Code terminals.
-   Increased the console menu label-width allowance to improve
    readability of longer package-management actions.
-   Management Console startup now suppresses the generic executable title bar
    and immediately takes ownership of screen rendering through its own title
    and menu renderer.
-   The Management Console title now shows the executing script Version and
    Build alongside the console title.
-   The footer layout now separates runtime state from direct actions and page
    navigation, with the shortcut legend rendered as a centered secondary line
    and page state kept visually distinct.
-   Console legend/page text now uses the same value/italic visual treatment as
    the hostname in the title bar.

### Fixed

-   Fixed the duplicate top separator line that could appear in the
    Management Console when running through SSH from PowerShell.
-   Fixed hidden console groups still allowing their menu items to
    participate in pagination/rendering.
-   Fixed console redraw width calculations so ANSI-styled text is measured by
    visible width rather than escape-sequence byte length.
-   Removed scrollback erase (`ESC[3J]`) from the shared clear-screen behavior
    after confirming it can produce terminal-dependent stale/reflowed lines and
    duplicate-looking top rows during redraws and resizes.

### Changed

-   `sgnd-bootstrap-env.sh` now consumes canonical definitions from
    `sgnd-definitions.sh` while retaining responsibility for
    runtime-derived paths, rebasing, user resolution, and directory
    construction.
-   `prepare-release.sh` now updates framework version/build identity in
    `sgnd-definitions.sh` instead of `sgnd-bootstrap-env.sh`.

## Machine and Network Configuration

### Added

-   Added DNS search-domain support to `set-identity.sh`.
-   Added an interactive **DNS search domain** prompt alongside the DNS
    server setting.
-   Added `--DNS-search` support for non-interactive and DNS-only
    network updates.
-   DNS search-domain values now participate in persistent script state.
-   Netplan generation now writes the configured DNS search domain
    beneath `nameservers.search`.

### Changed

-   DNS configuration now treats the DNS server and DNS search domain as
    a single network identity concern.
-   Active Directory provisioning and domain join now use the generic
    DNS-setting path instead of maintaining separate Netplan
    search-domain logic.
-   Management console now has a state variable SGND_CONSOLE_ROLE_AWARE
    indicating if only role appropriate menus are displayed
    
## Active Directory

### Added

-   Added an **Active Directory DNS** console group.
-   Added DNS-zone listing and host-record query actions.
-   Added actions to create and delete IPv4 host records in Samba Active
    Directory DNS.
-   Added an action to rerun DNS registration for the local domain
    controller.
-   Added client-side actions to manually add or remove the current
    machine's Active Directory DNS record.
-   Domain join now registers the joining machine's IPv4 host record in
    Active Directory DNS.
-   Domain join now configures the Active Directory DNS server and
    domain search suffix as part of client network configuration.

### Changed

-   **Show membership** now provides a consolidated client-domain status
    overview, including:
    -   Machine FQDN.
    -   Machine IPv4 address.
    -   Joined realm.
    -   Domain membership state.
    -   Active Directory DNS server.
    -   DNS host-record registration state.
    -   Registered DNS A-record address.
    -   Kerberos SRV availability.
    -   LDAP SRV availability.
-   Domain join now explicitly configures and validates the machine FQDN
    before joining the realm.
-   Active Directory DNS registration checks now query the authoritative
    AD DNS server directly rather than relying on the local resolver.
-   DNS host-record creation and deletion use shared non-interactive
    helpers so the same implementation is available to both console
    actions and domain join.

### Fixed

-   Fixed joined clients retaining only a short hostname instead of the
    expected fully qualified domain name.
-   Fixed DNS-registration status reporting false positives caused by
    local `/etc/hosts` resolution.
-   Fixed DNS helper variable scoping that could reduce a host FQDN to a
    malformed value such as `td-nas.`.
-   Fixed domain-joined Linux clients being unable to resolve short AD
    hostnames because no DNS search domain was configured.
-   Fixed the domain-join chain so a successful join results in a
    resolvable AD DNS A record for the client.

## Storage

### Added

-   Added storage provisioning for an unused disk, including:
    -   GPT partition creation.
    -   EXT4 or XFS filesystem creation.
    -   Persistent `/etc/fstab` configuration.
    -   Mounting at `/srv/storage`.
    -   Creation of the standard `/srv/storage/shares` directory.
-   Added actions to mount, unmount, and expand configured storage.
-   Added **Validate storage provisioning**, which verifies:
    -   The storage filesystem is mounted.
    -   The filesystem is mounted read/write.
    -   The configured source matches the active mount source.
    -   The persistent `/etc/fstab` entry is valid.
    -   The expected filesystem label is present.
    -   `/srv/storage` exists.
    -   `/srv/storage/shares` exists.
-   Added a separate **Storage Access** menu group for managing the
    ownership and permissions of:
    -   `/srv/storage`
    -   `/srv/storage/shares`
-   Added actions to:
    -   Show storage ownership and permissions.
    -   Set the storage owner.
    -   Set the storage group.
    -   Set storage permissions.
    -   Restore canonical storage permissions.
-   Canonical storage permissions can now be restored to:
    -   `/srv/storage` -- `root:root`, mode `0755`.
    -   `/srv/storage/shares` -- `root:root`, mode `0770`.

### Changed

-   **Show storage status** now reports:
    -   Mount source.
    -   Filesystem.
    -   Filesystem label.
    -   UUID.
    -   Mounted state.
    -   Persistent configuration state.
    -   `/etc/fstab` validity.
    -   Whether the active mount source matches the configured source.
    -   Whether the filesystem is mounted read/write.
    -   Storage-root and shares-root availability.
    -   Capacity and available space.
-   Replaced the misleading **Storage root writable** status with
    **Mounted read/write**.
-   Storage configuration now performs `systemctl daemon-reload` after
    updating `/etc/fstab`.

### Fixed

-   Fixed storage mount detection incorrectly treating `/srv/storage` as
    mounted when it was only an ordinary directory on the root
    filesystem.
-   Fixed storage status showing the capacity of the system root instead
    of the configured storage volume.
-   Fixed storage provisioning stopping after filesystem creation
    without completing persistent mounting.

## Samba File Server

### Added

-   Added Samba file-server package installation.
-   Added managed Samba share creation beneath `/srv/storage/shares`.
-   Added actions to list and remove managed Samba shares.
-   Share creation now:
    -   Creates the backing directory.
    -   Adds a managed section to `smb.conf`.
    -   Validates the configuration with `testparm`.
    -   Reloads Samba.
    -   Restores the previous configuration if validation fails.
-   Added file-server validation for:
    -   Samba tooling.
    -   Samba configuration.
    -   `smbd` service state.
    -   Mounted storage.
    -   The managed share root.
    -   Configured share backing directories.
-   Added a dedicated `manage-samba-shares.sh` executable for
    interactive share management.
-   The share manager supports:
    -   Listing all managed shares.
    -   Selecting one or more shares by number.
    -   Comma-separated selections.
    -   Numeric ranges.
    -   Selecting all shares.
    -   Keeping the selected collection active while applying multiple
        actions.
-   Added share-management actions to:
    -   Show share details.
    -   Set owner.
    -   Set group.
    -   Set Unix permissions.
    -   Restore default permissions.
    -   Validate selected shares.

### Changed

-   Replaced the separate share-permission menu actions with a single
    **Manage shares** action.
-   Share ownership and permission management is now handled by the
    dedicated share-management executable rather than repeated prompts
    in the console module.
-   The Samba module now delegates detailed share-management workflows
    while retaining installation, creation, removal, validation, and
    status actions.

## Installation and Release Management

### Added

-   Added the standalone `release-manager.sh` as the canonical
    SolidGroundUX installation and release-lifecycle tool, replacing the
    separate install, update, and uninstall workflow.
-   Added filesystem-based release state:
    -   `/var/lib/solidgroundux/releases` contains releases available
        for installation.
    -   `/var/lib/solidgroundux/archive/<release>` contains installed
        release history.
    -   The highest archived version represents the currently installed
        release.
-   Added interactive archived-release selection for reinstallation and
    rollback, with the current release identified and **Remove
    SolidGroundUX** available as the final action.
-   Added GitHub latest-release discovery and download support.
-   Added release acquisition through temporary staging, extraction,
    checksum validation, release-identity validation, and path-safety
    validation before a release is admitted into `releases/`.
-   Added bootstrap installation from a GitHub release ZIP containing
    `release-manager.sh` and the complete prepared release set.
-   Added automatic creation of the SolidGroundUX release-management
    directories during first installation.
-   Added automatic installation of a valid release set found beside the
    bootstrap copy of `release-manager.sh`.
-   Added automatic installation of the release manager itself at
    `/var/lib/solidgroundux/release-manager.sh`.
-   Added safe cleanup of known bootstrap files after a successful
    installation from a temporary directory.
-   Added command-line operations for checking, downloading, installing,
    updating, rolling back, reinstalling, and removing releases,
    including unattended and dry-run operation.

### Changed

-   Release-manager identity now follows the same canonical per-script
    metadata Version/Build mechanism as other SolidGroundUX executables;
    framework identity remains independently defined by
    `sgnd-definitions.sh`.
-   First-install extraction and copy handling now accounts for target
    directories that do not yet exist while preserving metadata of target
    directories that already exist.
-   First-time installation no longer requires manually creating the
    releases directory, copying release files into it, or extracting the
    framework archive directly into `/`.
-   Release bundles now act as self-contained bootstrap packages: they
    can be downloaded and extracted into a temporary directory and
    installed by running the bundled `release-manager.sh`.
-   Updates now install complete release archives and process the
    incoming `.removed` manifest for files that no longer belong to the
    new release.
-   Rollback now reinstalls a complete archived release and returns
    newer archived releases to `releases/`, preserving the
    filesystem-based current-version rule.
-   Removal now uses release manifests to remove framework-owned files
    while retaining release artifacts for later reinstallation.
-   Release-manager UI is self-contained and framework-independent while
    following the SolidGroundUX default visual conventions for titles,
    separators, labels, values, prompts, and status colors.
-   Updated deployment and installation documentation to describe the
    new `prepare-release.sh` → release artifacts → `release-manager.sh`
    workflow and distinguish it from direct development deployment
    through `deploy-workspace.sh`.

### Fixed

-   Fixed the fresh-machine bootstrap path so running `release-manager.sh` from
    an extracted release package does not stop after installing the manager
    itself: the bundled prepared release is admitted to the canonical
    `releases/` location and installation continues from there.
-   Fixed bootstrap handling so the release manager can relocate itself to
    `/var/lib/solidgroundux/release-manager.sh` without losing access to the
    release artifacts that accompanied the temporary bootstrap copy.
-   Tightened first-run release discovery and staging so a release extracted in
    a temporary directory follows the same validation and installation path as
    later downloaded or archived releases.

### Removed

-   The separate installer/updater/uninstaller architecture is
    superseded by `release-manager.sh`.
-   Removed the requirement for installation metadata or a separate
    current-version marker; release and archive directories now provide
    the required state.

## Development Tools

### Added

-   Added `create-wrappers.sh`, an interactive development utility for
    generating SolidGroundUX public command wrappers from executable scripts.
-   Wrapper generation supports source directory, filename or shell-style
    mask selection, configurable `bin` or `sbin` targets, and optional
    overwrite of existing wrappers.
-   Generated wrapper names conventionally use `sgnd-<scriptname>` without
    the `.sh` extension, while preserving names that already begin with
    `sgnd-`.
-   Generated wrappers resolve user-specific and system-wide SolidGroundUX
    configuration so they remain root-aware across development workspaces
    and installed systems.
-   Wrapper script targets are variable rather than tied to
    `usr/local/libexec/solidgroundux`, allowing wrappers for executables
    located elsewhere, including release-management tools.
-   Added **Create wrappers** to the Management Console Development Tools
    module.

-   `prepare-release.sh` now verifies that executable scripts directly
    beneath `usr/local/libexec/solidgroundux` have corresponding public
    command wrappers in `usr/local/bin`.
-   Added optional automatic creation of missing public command wrappers
    during release preparation.
-   `create-workspace.sh` now copies the canonical SolidGroundUX
    template set into the workspace under
    `target-root/usr/local/lib/solidgroundux/templates` and instantiates
    selected starter files from those workspace-local templates.

### Changed

-   `prepare-release.sh` now supports selecting a historical release
    manifest as the comparison baseline for generating the `.removed`
    manifest, allowing removals to be based on a chosen prior release.
-   Release preparation now writes the complete prepared release artifact
    set to the release output directory, including the archive, manifest,
    checksum files, removed manifest, and bundled `release-manager.sh`.
-   Missing canonical source headers encountered during release preparation
    are reported as warnings rather than aborting the release.
-   Consolidated release metadata maintenance into `prepare-release.sh`,
    superseding the separate metadata-editor workflow.

-   Version and Build metadata policies in `prepare-release.sh` now
    support `A` (all files), `C` (changed files only), and `N` (no
    update) independently.

-   Changed-file detection for release metadata uses the canonical
    header checksum mechanism, allowing source changes to be
    distinguished from Version, Build, and Checksum metadata changes.

-   Checksums are refreshed automatically for changed files and whenever
    release metadata changes a file.

-   Version and Build policy prompts now use constrained SolidGroundUX
    decision input with `C` as the default.

-   Corrected the `prepare-release.sh` argument specifications so `C` is
    stored as the default for Version and Build policies and `A,C,N`
    remains the choice list.

-   Workspace creation now follows the repository-shaped `target-root`
    layout more explicitly and uses its local template copy as the
    source for newly selected executable, library, and module starter
    files.

-   `sgnd_doc_renderer.py` now renders \$ marked entries only for
    template packages, : is rendered always

-   `deploy-workspace.sh` now ends with a redo/continue prompt: Continue
    exits cleanly, while `R` restarts the deployment from the beginning
    with the original arguments.

-   `deploy-workspace.sh` now uses `ask_datetime` for the **Changed
    after** prompt.

-   The deployment filter now accepts SolidGroundUX relative date/time
    expressions, such as `N`, `D`, `-2h`, and `-1d`, in addition to
    absolute dates and timestamps.

-   `deploy-workspace.sh` now displays a deployment summary after a
    successful transfer.

-   The deployment summary reports:

    -   Result.
    -   Transport.
    -   Source root.
    -   Destination.
    -   Receiver.
    -   Start and finish timestamps.
    -   Every transferred file.

-   The deployment summary now uses `sgnd_print_labeledmultivalue`,
    displaying transferred files on separate aligned lines instead of as
    a truncated comma-separated string.

-   `prepare-release.sh` now ensures that every regular file directly
    beneath `usr/local/libexec/solidgroundux` has its executable bit set
    before staging and archive creation.

-   Dry-run mode reports which executable permissions would be corrected
    without modifying the source tree.
